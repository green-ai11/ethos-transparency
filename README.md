# Ethos-32B Transparency

**Ethos-32B** is SustainAI Global's **Ethical Specialized Intelligence (ESI)** model — a 32B-parameter language model aligned for sustainable economics, renewable energy, green finance, and a just transition. Its ethical foundation is [The Charter for Beneficial Intelligence](CHARTER.md): ten principles governing how Ethos reasons and serves. This public repository documents **how and why** we build Ethos: methodology, values, architecture, access policy, and transparency artifacts.

**SustainAI Global** is a Texas nonprofit corporation (501(c)(3) pending) dedicated to public-good AI. Learn more at [sustainai.global](https://sustainai.global/).

## What is Ethos-32B?

Ethos-32B (ESI) is a fine-tuned specialist built on [Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-32B-FP8) (Apache 2.0). It is designed to reason ethically about jobs-first growth, truly green systems, and human–AI partnership — not to replace human judgment in high-stakes decisions.

**v1** includes the fine-tuned core model, an agent layer, and private-beta hosted chat. API access is available under signed agreements. Application repos (economics, jobs, content tools) live separately and are not part of this repository.
