# Training configuration (placeholders)

This directory will hold **skeleton, public-safe** training configuration references for transparency — not executable configs with secrets, API keys, or private paths.

---

## Current status

**No working configs are published yet.**

Planned placeholders (documentation only):

| File (planned) | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `qlora_sft_skeleton.yaml` | High-level QLoRA SFT parameters (ranks, targets) — values TBD |
| `unsloth_notes.md` | Public notes on QLoRA via **Unsloth** — skeleton config forthcoming |
| `phase_manifest.md` | Mapping of training phases to config files — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) |

---

## What will not appear here

- Live API keys or Hugging Face tokens
- Private cloud instance IDs or internal hostnames
- Copy-paste training commands tied to paid GPU accounts
- Hyperparameter grids from undisclosed experiments

Full training execution remains in the private development repository by invitation.
